Hi, im joseph keyworth :)
I'm a student of computer science looking for a placement for my third year, i'm really excited to start working with people.
you can contact me through email @ keyworthjoseph@gmail.com, I check it regularly so i'll get back as quick as I can.
My portfolio can be found on this account, feel free to look through them. In terms of hobbies: i'm currently working on a personal website for myself, and a gift for my parents, so most of the stuff on here will be university work.
I hope you enjoy,
Thank you.
